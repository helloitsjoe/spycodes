# Spyfreaks

Connect with as many people as you want, divide into teams, pick a spymaster for
each team, and play!

## To run locally

```
yarn && yarn start
```

This will serve your app on your local network, using your computer's local IP
address. You should see a log `http://<IP address>:8080` when you run
`yarn start`. Open a browser to this address to play as a player, or add
`/freakmaster` to the URL to play as the spymaster.
